How to connect front and back end:
The front end is the repository called frontend. The backend is the repository called fe-code-challenge. 
Clone this frontend repository and the fe-code-challenge repository in two separate IDEs.
Open two separate terminals.
In each, navigate into one of fe-code-challenge, and frontend.
Now, in one terminal you will be in fe-code-challenge, in another you'll be in frontend
in fe-code-challenge, type in npm start
If this doesn't work, run this command: npm install -g ts-node
To launch the frontend, type npm start
The website will be running on localhost:3000 and connected to the backend at localhost:8000


Design choices:
I chose react.js because I'm more comfortable with and and have more experience with it. I believe I can learn vue.js given its component structure being similar to react. However, under limited time, I thought it was safest to use what I know.
